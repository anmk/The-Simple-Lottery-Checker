# The Simple Lottery Checker

![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/anmk/the-simple-lottery-checker?style=plastic)

The application can target to find lotteries of six-number results. This website includes users authorization system. It can save the chosen numbers. The application has support for languages selection. I have built it using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. App version: 1.2

The author tried really hard to make the application very good but he is not responsible for any errors.
